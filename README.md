# Login-Authenticator
Sign ups and Log in authenticator with MongoDB





# For the Local server, install these:

- npm init -y

- npm install express mongoose body-parser cors

- npm install bcrypt mongoose express body-parser cors

- npm install --save mongoose-unique-validator



# USAGE:

- Run your nodejs server file
- Make sure your mongodb compass is open and running, plus active connection with a point
- Ensure your server side code connects to the same point as your MongoDB compass
- And ensure your server file is running on a certain port. I have set it to 5000
- And on client side, used the server side point (5000) to access it.
