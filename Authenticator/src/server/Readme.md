# For the Local server, install these:

- npm init -y

- npm install express mongoose body-parser cors

- npm install bcrypt mongoose express body-parser cors

- npm install --save mongoose-unique-validator



# Run your Server side js file

- Make sure your compass is open and running, plus active connection with a point
- Ensure your server side connects to the same point as your MongoDB compass
- And ensure it is running on a certain port
- And on client side, we must use the server side point to access it
